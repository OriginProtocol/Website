msgid "It is essential that we also incentivize developers and marketplace operators to use the Origin Platform. As such, we have launched an advertising and promotions program that creates a built-in business model for the decentralized marketplaces operating on Origin."
msgstr "激勵平臺平臺開發和市場運營商使用Origin也很重要。 因此，我們已經啟動了一個廣告和促進計畫，為在Origin上的去中心化市場運營創建了一個內置商業模型。"

msgid "Sellers on Origin-enabled applications can promote their listings with OGN to get higher visibility on the search and browse results on our flagship app and partner apps. Currently, the only way to participate in this program is to pay with OGN. When sellers create listings, they can add OGN commissions to their listings. This OGN is placed into escrow in our Marketplace Smart Contract"
msgstr "賣家可以在支援Origin的應用上，通過OGN推廣他們的產品，從而在我們的應用和合作夥伴應用上獲得更高的搜索和流覽結果。 目前，參與該專案的唯一方式是使用OGN支付。 當賣家創建清單時，他們可以在清單中添加OGN傭金。 這個OGN被置於我們的市場智慧合約中託管。"

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:240
msgid "Then, when sales are finalized, OGN commissions are given to the apps that brought counterparties (the buyers) to fulfill the sales. This gives developers incentives to promote these seller listings, as well as compete amongst themselves to drive the most sales for sellers. "
msgstr "然後當買賣完成後，OGN傭金會被給到帶來買家的應用，以促進交易。 這讓開發者有動力去推廣這些賣家產品，同時他們之間也會相互競爭，為賣家帶來最多的銷量。 "

msgid "To give a more specific example, let’s assume that a NYC-based home owner wants to put her apartment up for home-sharing on the Origin network. She inputs that she is willing to pay a 20 OGN commission every single time her apartment is rented out for one evening. Multiple home-sharing applications are now incentivized to feature her apartment so that they can compete for the OGN commissions. When one application acts as the final point of sale for a booking by finding the seller a renter, the application developer is rewarded the 20 OGN that she has offered up as commission"
msgstr "舉一個例子，我們假設一個紐約的房主想把她的公寓放在Origin上。 她輸入說，公寓每被出租一晚，她願意支付20個OGN作為傭金。 這樣，多家共用住宅的應用都會受到鼓勵鼓勵並競爭OGN傭金。 當一個應用作為最終為賣方找到一個租客時，應用的開發人員將獲得那20個OGN獎勵。"

msgstr "未來其他人也可以獲得傭金獎勵，博客作者、媒體大V以及其他機構或個人等都將能從賣家手中賺取賺取OGN傭金。 "

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:254
msgid "Origin Commissions is a new advertising and promotions model that is superior to traditional paid marketing (CPC and CPM) models. Advertisers (sellers) only pay in OGN tokens when successful sales have occurred. Similarly, the publishers (application creators, bloggers, other affiliates, etc.) are only paid when real transactions happen. This creates a much more efficient attribution model than the one that traditional advertising offers. Origin Commissions aligns the interests of sellers, application creators, and other affiliates to promote listings to buyers across the Origin network."
msgstr "Origin傭金計畫是一種新的廣告和促銷模式，優於傳統的付費行銷(CPC和CPM) 模式，當一次交易發生時，廣告商(賣方) 只使用OGN進行支付。 類似地，發行者(應用建立者、博客作者、其他機構活個人等)，他們只有在真正發生交易時才會得到報酬。 這創造了一個比傳統廣告更有效的模型。 Origin傭金將銷售者、應用開發者和其他附屬機構的利益聯合起來，通過Origin網路向買家推廣他們的產品。"

#: templates/whitepaper/platform.html:264
msgid "For example, users that earn OGN through Origin Rewards will be able to instantly use their tokens to purchase goods and services on our flagship marketplace, decentralized e-commerce platform and other future applications. This lowers the user friction of users having to acquire ETH or DAI outside of the platform before they are able to be viable buyers in the system."
msgstr "例如，通過Origin Rewards賺取OGN的使用者將能夠立即使用OGN在我們的旗艦市場，去中心化電商平臺或未來其他應用程式上購買商品和服務。 因此，使用者在完成交易前不需在Origin平臺之外先獲取ETH或DAI，從而減少了使用者將體驗到的摩擦。"

msgid "For the past two decades, Internet marketplaces and e-commerce stores have changed the way that buyers and sellers connect, creating new opportunities for the exchange of goods and services. However, these marketplaces have always been governed by centralized companies that maintain their individual monopolies on data, transaction and other service fees, and ultimately, user choice. With blockchain and other distributed technologies beginning to hit the mainstream, the world is poised for a new wave of decentralized commerce."
msgstr "過去二十年，互聯網市場改變了買家和賣家的互聯方式，為商品及服務交換創造了新的機會。 但是，這些市場始終由中心式公司管理，這些公司在資料、交易和其他服務費用以及最終的使用者選擇方面維持著壟斷地位。 隨著區塊鏈和其他分散式技術開始吸引主流關注，全世界已經準備好迎來新一波的分散式商務浪潮。"

msgid "Most sharing economy businesses have several things in common."
msgstr "大多數共用經濟企業都有幾個共同點。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:23
msgid "First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously. Suppliers have used these platforms to reach customers at greater scale and ease than before. Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market."
msgstr "首先，這些公司集合起來對全世界產生了深遠的影響。 市場的消費者已經能夠通過獲得以前沒有的產品和服務來改善他們的生活。 供應商使用這些新平臺接觸客戶時，無論是規模還是方便性都更勝從前。 每個市場都為賣家和買家創造出一個「家」，允許他們聚到一起進行交易，為那個市場創造出流動性。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:24
msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."
msgstr "其次，大多數共用經濟企業遵循相同的增長週期。 除了個別例外，這些市場非常難啟動和發展。 市場企業僅僅在起步階段就往往需要數百萬美元，以Uber和Airbnb為例，它們耗資數十億美元才形成規模。 這些企業在早期階段的運營中出現巨額虧損，這是很普遍的情況。 事實上，這些公司在為使用市場的參與者提供補貼。 但是，由於強大的跨邊網路效應<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>,，成功的市場企業能夠隨著時間的推移讓收入以指數級增長，而且通常是通過對網路上產生的每筆交易收取手續費。 網路效應企業（如共用經濟市場）通常是「贏家通吃」的企業<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a>，在成熟階段為主管公司和股東從網路中攫取出搞得不成比例的價值。 一旦達到一定的規模，他們從很多角度來看都很像壟斷企業。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:28
msgid "Finally, while there are very significant differences in user experience, business mechanics, and vertical-specific features among Internet marketplace companies, they all share many pieces that have been built and rebuilt many times. Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."
