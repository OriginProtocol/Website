msgid "Origin Protocol (Origin), a blockchain technology company developing decentralized commerce and finance (DeFi) applications, is pleased to be engaged by Brave Browser (Brave) in its switch from a centralized e-commerce platform to Origin’s decentralized Dshop platform. Working jointly with Brave, Origin enabled Brave to accept payments in its native token, BAT, for merchandise for the very first time. As part of the engagement, Origin also helped Brave sell its first ever non-fungible token (NFT) collection, which sold out in minutes."

Previously Brave’s merchandise store only accepted credit cards and was on a completely centralized platform."

msgid "Origin helped Brave switch from Shopify to the Dshop platform. The NFT integration to Dshop in collaboration with Brave led to a highly successful outcome for both parties. Brave sold all 30 NFTs, a result of a BAT token holder community campaign to create tokenized images of BAT memes, in just under two minutes. In addition, Brave continues to do brisk business through Dshop split between credit card payments and cryptocurrency payments."

Brave wanted to signal to their token holders that they were committed to decentralized tech while still being able to serve their tens of millions of users who may be unfamiliar with it. Their previous platform could only serve the latter group. Brave’s first NFT collection sale was a smash success and we look forward to continuing a long-term, mutually rewarding relationship with them.”"

#: templates/litepaper/exec-summary.html:10
msgid "The first significant wave of users of decentralized commerce applications will be those seeking experiences or products they cannot get from centralized alternatives. Many of these early users will be crypto natives. The most prominent product category to emerge is the Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) vertical. NFTs do not merely represent digital collectibles but can create entirely new experiences for creators and communities."
msgstr ""

#: templates/litepaper/exec-summary.html:13
msgid "NFTs can function as digital collectibles. Further, they can be  tokenized representations of physical goods and collectibles, unlock other digital content, and act as access tokens to digital or in-person experiences. NFTs can be used for a wide array of financial applications and use cases. The design space for NFTs is nearly unlimited and represents an exciting paradigm shift for blockchain technology."

Over <a href='https://defipulse.com/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>$40B of value</a> is locked in DeFi protocols, and this number is expected to grow by multiple orders of magnitude in the next few years. However, we are still in the very early innings of the DeFi movement."
msgstr ""

#: templates/litepaper/exec-summary.html:19
msgid "Today most DeFi participants are highly sophisticated and number in the tens of thousands of users, while the majority of cryptocurrency users numbering in the millions have not yet adopted these technologies en masse. Interacting with DeFi protocols is difficult and cumbersome, requiring complicated operations like staking/unstaking, measuring impermanent loss, and paying expensive gas fees. Further, hundreds of millions to billions of mainstream consumers, merchants, retail investors, small businesses, and global enterprises have very little knowledge of these permissionless financial protocols and are unable to participate in perhaps the most disruptive movement in finance since the very invention of money itself."
msgstr ""

#: templates/litepaper/exec-summary.html:22
msgid "While there are both buyers and sellers that transact across various verticals with stablecoins and/or Bitcoin and Ether, existing widespread payment methods like credit cards and mobile payments are still preferred by many crypto-savvy users for their ubiquity, convenience, and lack of pricing volatility. Peer-to-peer commerce is handicapped until cryptocurrencies become the dominant form of medium of exchange."
msgstr ""

#: templates/litepaper/exec-summary.html:25
msgid "Simply creating a commerce platform using decentralized technologies does not guarantee widespread merchant and consumer adoption. Only by creating new killer applications that are not possible without crypto-centric technologies will our industry succeed in creating a more open, permissionless, and resilient future for global commerce and finance that impacts hundreds of millions or billions of lives."

The rate of growth in NFT sales and trade volume and the rate of innovation in the space is exponential. Top brands like the NBA and MLB have already gotten involved and everyone from Andreessen Horowitz from the New York Times is investing in or commenting on NFTs. NFTs have the potential to disrupt the music industry ($70B+ a year), fine art sales ($60B+ a year), video games ($140B+ a year), the collectibles market ($370B+ a year), and many other industries. NFTs represent a massive disruptive opportunity that can touch virtually every aspect of global culture and commerce."

This is a key factor that makes us believe NFTs will be the first product category that onboards mainstream users into crypto. The platform that is able to successfully onboard both creators and purchasers of NFTs will capture tremendous value. We intend to be that platform."

Investors and lenders should be earning yields at 10 to 100 times (10-20%%) at what is offered currently by traditional banking systems. Borrowers should have easier access to credit to finance their investments, businesses, and other enterprises. Further, this all needs to happen in frictionless and easy ways that are in stark contrast to the product experiences of today’s first-generation DeFi products."

We need to propagate cryptocurrency payment rails that are superior to existing credit/debit cards and mobile payments that rely on fiat currencies and centralized systems."

For example, a collector can purchase an NFT that entitles them with the rights to redeem that NFT for fine art, luxury handbags, or other products but can store that product with the original manufacturer. Redemption can happen at any point in the future. Again, because NFTs are exchangeable, collectors could invest in luxury items with the hopes of these items appreciating in value.

In addition, in contrast to existing players in the market like Nifty Gateway, we believe the creators should own the branding and have direct control over pricing models (e.g. different auction mechanics or tiered pricing). Origin’s NFT Launchpad gives creators and influencers more direct control over their content and their physical, digital, and experiential products. Just as many merchants have chosen Shopify over selling on generic marketplaces that do not allow for custom branding and direct relationships to end customers, we believe the same model will be successful for NFTs. Further, many creators prefer Origin’s NFT platform because they do not need to share the stage with other competing NFT drops that may be off-brand.

msgstr "大多數共用經濟企業都有幾個共同點。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:23
msgid "First, as a collection, these companies have created tremendous impact to the world. Consumers of marketplaces have been able to improve their lives with access to products and services that were not available previously. Suppliers have used these platforms to reach customers at greater scale and ease than before. Each marketplace creates a “home” for buyer and supplier to come together and transact, creating liquidity for that market."
msgstr "首先，這些公司集合起來對全世界產生了深遠的影響。 市場的消費者已經能夠通過獲得以前沒有的產品和服務來改善他們的生活。 供應商使用這些新平臺接觸客戶時，無論是規模還是方便性都更勝從前。 每個市場都為賣家和買家創造出一個「家」，允許他們聚到一起進行交易，為那個市場創造出流動性。"

#: templates/whitepaper/why.html:24
msgid "Second, most sharing economy businesses follow the same growth lifecycle. Save for a few exceptions, these marketplaces are notoriously difficult to start and grow. Marketplace businesses oftentimes require millions of dollars to just get off the ground and, in the case of Uber and Airbnb, billions to scale. It’s the norm for these businesses to run at a deep loss in the early days. In effect, the corporation is subsidizing the usage of the marketplace for the participants. However, because of highly positive cross-side network effects<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>, successful marketplace businesses are able to grow revenue exponentially over time, usually by charging a service fee for every transaction that happens on network. Network effect businesses, like sharing economy marketplaces, are usually winner-takes-all businesses<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a> and at mature stages extract a disproportionate amount of value from the network forthe managing corporations and their shareholders. In many ways, they begin looking like monopolies once they reach scale."
msgstr "其次，大多數共用經濟企業遵循相同的增長週期。 除了個別例外，這些市場非常難啟動和發展。 市場企業僅僅在起步階段就往往需要數百萬美元，以Uber和Airbnb為例，它們耗資數十億美元才形成規模。 這些企業在早期階段的運營中出現巨額虧損，這是很普遍的情況。 事實上，這些公司在為使用市場的參與者提供補貼。 但是，由於強大的跨邊網路效應<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote2'>2</a>,，成功的市場企業能夠隨著時間的推移讓收入以指數級增長，而且通常是通過對網路上產生的每筆交易收取手續費。 網路效應企業（如共用經濟市場）通常是「贏家通吃」的企業<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote3'>3</a>，在成熟階段為主管公司和股東從網路中攫取出搞得不成比例的價值。 一旦達到一定的規模，他們從很多角度來看都很像壟斷企業。"

Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash have each individually engineered their own solutions to user and supplier profiles, purchase experiences, matching algorithms, and reviews and ratings. This is valuable proprietary technology on the one hand. On the other, it is a wasteful use of time and effort to reinvent the wheel each time to create a new marketplace vertical. Consumers are also left creating and managing dozens of accounts on these marketplace companies, each of which owns their personal data and transaction history."
msgstr "最後，儘管互聯網市場公司之間的使用者體驗、商業機制和垂直化特性方面存在非常大的差異，但它們都有很多一而再、再而三打造出的共同點。 Lyft、Postmates和DoorDash針對使用者和供應商設定檔、購買體驗、匹配演算法以及評論和評分各自設計出了解決方案。 一方面，這是極具價值的專有技術。 另一方面，每次在構建新的垂直化市場時都把輪子重新發明一遍，這是對時間和精力的雙重浪費。 使用者也需要創建和管理很多不同的帳戶，而且所有的公司都擁有和掌控著他們的個人資料和交易歷史。"

Sure, they benefited by making revenue on the platform, but they are not getting outsized rewards for their integral contributions in the early days of the marketplace like employees and investors are.

That might have been the right decision for Airbnb, but the company’s customers deserve to know the truth so they can make informed decisions with whom to transact business. With the blockchain, everything is public and immutable, so transparency is a default feature."
msgstr "每個市場運營公司都對使用者和交易資料的存儲實施控制，這些存儲資料非常寶貴，但並不公開。 我們相信，使用者應當能夠擁有並控制自己的資料。 我們還相信，對信任而言，透明度至關重要。 太多的企業出於自身利益控制著屬於使用者自己的資料。 一些房客在一套早期的Airbnb公寓中製造冰毒，而 Airbnb的律師團隊立即炮製出保密協定，並用封口費來防止負面輿情擴散。 對於Airbnb而言，這個決定可能是正確的，但公司的客戶應當瞭解真相，這樣他們才能在選擇交易對象時做出明智的決定。 採用區塊鏈，一切都是公開的、恒定的，因此透明度成為了一種預設特性。"

msgid "The market is ready for a new peer-to-peer form of commerce. The world is moving to a gig economy where more and more individuals provide goods and services as their primary or supplemental way of earning income. Over 22%% of US adults have become suppliers to the sharing economy as of 2016<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote10'>10</a> and this number is expected to increase over time. These suppliers will hugely benefit from an open network that does not charge exorbitant transaction and service fees."
msgstr "市場已經準備好迎來一種全新的分散式商務模式。 全世界正在發展出一種零工經濟，越來越多的個人提供服務，作為他們主要或補充性的收入模式。 截至2016年<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote10'>10</a>，全美國超過22%%的成年人成為了共用經濟的供應商。 如果存在一個不收取巨額交易費和服務費的開放網路，那麼這些供應商就能從中大大獲利。"

msgid "While the overall market continues to boom, value capture has only shifted in favor to the regional monopolies. Recently, Airbnb dramatically increased fees for hosts in many global regions, from 3 to 5 percent to 14 percent<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote13'>13</a>. Similarly, Uber’s advertised 25%% commission rate is actually significantly higher when factoring in additional fees that are passed onto their drivers. For example, the median commission that Uber charges in San Francisco was recently estimated at 39%%<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote14'>14</a>"
msgstr "雖然整個市場持續蓬勃增長，但價值獲取都被區域壟斷者捕捉了。 最近，Airbnb全球許多地區的房東費用大幅增加，從 3%% 到 5%% 到 14%%<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote13'>13</a>。 同樣，如果考慮到轉嫁到司機身上的額外費用，Uber所宣傳的25%%傭金率實際上要高得多。 舉個例，Uber在三藩市收取的傭金中位數最近估計為39%%<a class='whitepaper-footnote-link' href='#footnote14'>14</a>。"

msgid "The world is also moving more and more to global versus local commerce. Sellers are able to provide services (and many times products and goods) to customers across the world. Currently, a Lyft passenger would not be able to ride on the Didi ChuXing ride-sharing network (China’s largest ride-sharing company) save for the fact that the two companies signed a deep partnership that was months in the making and involved a mutual investor pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into both companies. In a global, but openly distributed marketplace, a customer would be able to purchase services from suppliers without a need for new accounts, complicated currency exchanges, or prerequisite negotiated deals."
msgstr "同時，全世界的商務模式越來越趨向于全球化，而非當地語系化。 賣家能夠向全世界的客戶提供服務(很 多時候是產品及商品)。 目前，Lyft 兩家公司簽訂了一份醞釀數月之久、涉及相互投資(對兩家公司 注資數百萬美元) 的深度合作協定，乘客將無法用「滴滴出行」拼車網路(中國最大的拼車公司) 來 乘車。 在一個全球化但呈開放分散式的市場中，客戶無需新帳戶、複雜的貨幣兌換或必要的交易協商 就能從供應商那裡購買服務。"

While this effectively targets the early adopter community that has developed around Ethereum, we recognize that the minting costs of today’s Ethereum NFTs, oftentimes $25 to $50+ per NFT, make these NFTs prohibitively expensive for more mainstream adoption. In order to bring NFTs to the hundreds of millions of consumers, NFTs must be cheaper to mint. To tackle this volume-centric strategy, Origin will begin integrations with alternative blockchains and also explore Ethereum layer 2 solutions in Q3. Our goal is to enable creators to offer NFTs at $10 to $20 that can be purchased by their mainstream in seconds with credit and debit cards. This will be especially important for NFT use cases related to merchandise, ticketing, and collectibles."

Instead of losing money on each sale, they are instantly adding capital to their merchant accounts that compounds instantly, giving them more operating capital over time. For merchants that oftentimes face cash flow management and inventory issues, being able to accept a yield-bearing form of payment is extremely compelling."
