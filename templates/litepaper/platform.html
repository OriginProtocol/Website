  <p>{{gettext("Since our founding in 2017, Origin has focused on enabling commerce on the blockchain. We’ve powered sales of physical goods and offline services (e.g. home rentals).

  <p>{{gettext("While we plan to address commerce across many different verticals, today we are keenly focused on crypto-specific commerce opportunities that target early adopters of our technology. In the last few months, we’ve had tremendous success in the non-fungible token (NFT) market.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("We believe NFTs are a nascent but highly disruptive technology that will bring our crypto-centric commerce products to millions, if not hundreds of millions, of users in the next few years. At the time of writing, Origin’s NFT Launchpad set all-time records for largest music NFT sale at nearly $11.7M with <a href='https://nft.3lau.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>3LAU</a> and largest viral video/meme NFT sale at $760k with the original viral video, <a href='http://charliebitme.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Charlie Bit My Finger</a>.

In both instances, Origin saw significantly increased community membership and engagement and interest in OGN following these record-breaking events. We believe that future blockbuster NFT sales will further introduce mainstream audiences to the Origin Commerce Platform and OGN.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("The overall market for NFTs is about to hit an explosive inflection point, and Origin is very well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity. While NBA Top Shots has recently seen a decrease in secondary sales, over $200M of transactions were achieved in both February and March of 2021. In May, Larva Labs sold nearly $90M of NFTs in 24 hours with their <a href='http://meebits.io' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Meebits</a> launch. This was soon followed by mainstream business influencer Gary Vaynerchuk launching <a href='http://veefriends.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Veefriends</a> successfully. It is clear that NFT sales are growing at an exponential rate and represent the fastest growing opportunity for crypto-centric commerce. Even more importantly, we are now seeing iconic global brands and personalities like Gucci, the Golden State Warriors, Playboy, and Paris Hilton embrace NFT technology to interact more directly with their fanbases.")}}</p>

  <p>{{gettext("However, we believe that the majority of the market misconstrues NFTs as simply scarce digital art. While digital art is one exciting vertical that we have been able to capitalize on, we believe Origin’s NFT Launchpad will redefine commerce in several other key verticals as well.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Origin’s NFT Launchpad will redefine commerce in several key verticals.")}}</p>

  <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("NFTs that are redeemable for offline goods")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In May 2020, Grammy-winning DJ RAC released his $TAPE NFTs that were redeemable for physical cassette tapes. Little did he know that he would be setting the record for the final sale price of a single cassette tape, as $TAPE tokens redeemable for the cassette tapes eventually cleared $3,000 per token.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("This is just one example of how NFTs have changed the landscape for limited-edition premium products. NFTs that represent physical offline goods can be authenticated on the blockchain. Influencers, artists, creators, and other merchants can now issue NFTs that are both certifiably scarce and representative of valuable physical items.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("There is an enormous opportunity to use NFTs to power these creator communities. Because NFTs are freely exchangeable on the blockchain, they also inherently create an after-market for limited edition goods.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("One needs only to reference StockX, the premium sneaker marketplace that is currently valued at $2.8 B, to recognize the possibility of NFTs flourishing in many verticals where scarcity and authenticity need to be enforced. Today, the company generates $400M in revenue by taking fees to certify that premium sneakers are legitimate and not fraudulent. Using NFTs that are tied to these sneakers would establish a clear sense of provenance as sneakers are sold from one buyer to the next.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In another manifestation of using NFTs connected to offline products, the limited goods do not need to be redeemed. For example, a collector can purchase an NFT that entitles them with the rights to redeem that NFT for fine art, luxury handbags, or other products but can store that product with the original manufacturer. Redemption can happen at any point in the future. Again, because NFTs are exchangeable, collectors could invest in luxury items with the hopes of these items appreciating in value. However, they no longer need to take physical delivery and can simply sell the NFTs representing the items in an after market to profit from their investments.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Taking this one model one step further, NFT-powered commerce can generate revenue even before products are developed or manufactured. In the web 2.0 world, we saw how crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Gofundme were able to generate demand for creator projects. In the web 3.0, NFTs can be a better form to issue ownership of future redeemable products. Once again, because these NFTs are freely exchangeable they provide backers the ability to resell their ownership even before the projects are completed.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("At Origin, we have conducted NFT sales for mega-influencer <a href='https://nft.jakepaul.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Jake Paul</a> and One Republic frontman, <a href='https://nft.ryantedder.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Ryan Tedder</a>, that enabled collectors to receive limited edition physical merchandise in addition to their NFTs. We have even helped secretive, but highly funded electric bike startup Micro pre-sell their earliest e-bikes that will come off the assembly line. In the far future, we imagine using  NFTs as the technology for tracking ownership of major physical items like homes and cars instead of the arcane processes we have today, like going down to the local courthouse to make sure no one else is claiming to own the same property.")}}</p>

  <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("NFTs that access digital content")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("We intend to release NFT features that also provide holders access to digital content and services. For example, content providers can replace paywall subscriptions with NFT ownership. Users that have purchased NFTs can unlock premium articles, unreleased music, premium video content, or special features in social and mobile games.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Here are a few examples of how this might work. Today, Patreon influencers allow their super fans to access unique content through the platform. The company generates $50M of revenue and is currently valued at $1.2B. However, these subscriptions and individual payments are tied to unique users. In tomorrow’s world, creators can issue NFTs that unlock special video or music content instead.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In late Q3 2021, we expect many of our NFT sales to feature unlockable content. Users only need to have purchased NFTs in their Origin managed wallets or a web3 wallet like Metamask to get access to premium content offered by our many creators.")}}</p>
  
  <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("NFTs that are access tokens")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("A third opportunity that is a multi-billion dollar opportunity in NFT-powered commerce lies in experiential commerce. NFTs that are certifiable on the blockchain can guarantee authenticity of tickets for professional sports, concerts, and other live performances. This reduces the risk of fraudulent tickets and also maintains clear provenance of ticket resales.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("Going back to the Patreon example, a creator NFT may enable a user to get a 1-on-1 video chat with their favorite celebrity. Another user can purchase a premium NFT that grants them backstage access to their favorite musicians concerts for life.")}}</p>
  <p>{{gettext("In our highly successful <a href='https://nft.bassjackers.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Bassjackers</a> NFT sale, the winning bidder was given the ability to name a track and appear on stage with BassJackers at future music festivals and concerts.")}}</p>

    <h2>{{gettext("NFT Launchpad")}}</h2>
    <p>{{gettext("The key to unlocking value in all of these crypto-centric opportunities with NFTs is making NFT issuance dead simple for creators. In addition, in contrast to existing players in the market like Nifty Gateway, we believe the creators should own the branding and have direct control over pricing models (e.g. different auction mechanics or tiered pricing). Origin’s NFT Launchpad gives creators and influencers more direct control over their content and their physical, digital, and experiential products. Just as many merchants have chosen Shopify over selling on generic marketplaces that do not allow for custom branding and direct relationships to end customers, we believe the same model will be successful for NFTs. Further, many creators prefer Origin’s NFT platform because they do not need to share the stage with other competing NFT drops that may be off-brand. We have also lowered the user experience barriers for newcomers to NFTs. While many of the other platforms require using cryptocurrency, we also offer the ability to purchase NFTs with credit and debit cards.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("In the near future, we intend to form additional partnerships with additional mainstream influencers and iconic brands to power their NFT commerce initiatives. We believe there is a huge untapped market for monetizing premium, limited-edition online and offline goods and services through our latest NFT product upgrades to the Origin Platform.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("We are especially excited about several NFT Launchpad upgrades that are scheduled to launch in Q3 of 2021.")}}</p>

    <p><i>{{gettext("Self-serve NFT launchpad")}}</i></p>

    <p>{{gettext("Today, Origin’s NFT Launchpad is a curated experience for our collectors and is an invite-only platform. For creators, we build custom storefronts that oftentimes require several weeks of engineering work. While this allows us to hold record-breaking NFT sales with top creators, the last thing we want to do in the long-term is to become the gatekeepers of which creators can launch NFT drops.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("We have thousands of inbound requests from creators of all sizes, from verticals like music, art, sports, retail, and many others. We are excited to open the NFT Launchpad to all interested creators by the second half of 2021 with the launch of our self-serve WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor.")}}</p>

    <!-- insert WYSIWYG screenshot -->

    <p>{{gettext("Creators will be able to create Origin accounts, upload audio and visual assets for their NFTs and customized websites, and schedule NFT sales using a variety of different sale formas (e.g. 1 of 1 auctions, leaderboard auctions, open editions, limited editions, and more). NFT Launchpad will democratize NFT creation and sales. Importantly, Origin will share in the proceeds of NFT sales conducted by our creators, creating substantial revenue-generating possibilities for us.")}}</p>

    <!-- insert sales types screenshot -->

    <p><i>{{gettext("Site-specific and Aggregator NFT Marketplaces")}}</i></p>

    <p>{{gettext("Secondary market sales are vital for true price discovery of NFTs and the maturation of this nascent market. We intend to build a marketplace platform for secondary market sales of all NFTs launched on our Launchpad as well NFTs from other platforms and marketplaces. The Origin team already has over 4 years of experience building peer-to-peer marketplace technology, and we are the leaders in this field. The original Origin Marketplace was launched on Ethereum mainnet in 2018 and supported tens of thousands of users and listings for a variety of goods and services. Origin fully intends on being the NFT marketplace leader and capturing NFT sales from our partner creators as well as creators who launch independently or with another platform.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Our marketplace product will allow for both site-specific marketplaces and a larger Origin-branded aggregator marketplace.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("With the former implementation, secondary marketplaces can be run and curated by the NFT creators themselves. Again, these marketplaces can live on the individual creators’ websites. Gallerists and artists have always cared deeply about presentation and curation as it can have a strong impact on the price of their assets. In another scenario, one can imagine top brands like Marvel or the NFL wanting to showcase secondary sales of their NFTs in more brand-centric experiences. Letting creators control every aspect of their NFT from creation to secondary market sale is a key differentiator to Origin’s NFT platform over more generic NFT marketplaces. Fans of specific creators and artists will also appreciate going direct to the source instead of browsing through unrelated listings on a generalized marketplace.")}}</p>

    <!-- insert 3LAU marketplace mockup -->

    <p>{{gettext("With the Origin-branded marketplace, we will aggregate all our NFT sales on a single website that makes it easy for buyers to discover new creators. Site-specific marketplace NFTs will be aggregated to the Origin-branded marketplace. In the future, we will allow for creators like brands and celebrities to promote their NFTs on the Origin-branded marketplace. This is similar to how Google AdWords works and presents a potentially lucrative additional business model for Origin.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Creators are excited about custom NFT marketplaces because they allow them to better monetize their creations over a longer period of time. Artists will experience increased value capture from programmatic transaction fees attached to NFTs they create. This means that any secondary market sales will generate revenue for NFT creators in perpetuity. Previously, musical artists would only capture a small portion of this value through royalties and fine artists would capture no value from secondary sales.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Not only are secondary market sales important for price discovery, revenue sharing from these sales will be one of the key revenue drivers for Origin’s Launchpad. Far more volume is done on the secondary market than during initial sales and we expect record-breaking trades in the future. Origin intends to build a fully-featured NFT platform and ecosystem. We will develop the best end-to-end NFT platform in the space and capture massive value for our users, NFT creator partners, and our token holders.")}}</p>

    <p><i>{{gettext("OGN buybacks and other token utilities")}}</i></p>
        <p>{{gettext("We may conduct additional OGN buybacks over time using revenue generated from the various income streams that are being developed across the NFT launchpad (e.g. primary sales proceeds, secondary sales revenue share, paid promotion by creators). We conducted our first buyback at the end of May 2021 for $1.3M worth of OGN.")}}</p>
        <p>{{gettext("We also anticipate tightly coupling OGN into our self-serve and marketplace products. For example, we intend to experiment with allowing creators to stake OGN for increased revenue share. There may also be certain NFT sales that will be structured around buyers using OGN for special bonuses and perks (e.g. require OGN staking or payment for drawing/raffle sales). It is also anticipated that OGN will be the native currency for paid promotion on our aggregator marketplace.")}}</p>

    <p><i>{{gettext("Mainstream NFTs")}}</i></p>
    <p>{{gettext("Origin’s NFTs are currently Ethereum ERC-721 NFTs. While this effectively targets the early adopter community that has developed around Ethereum, we recognize that the minting costs of today’s Ethereum NFTs, oftentimes $25 to $50+ per NFT, make these NFTs prohibitively expensive for more mainstream adoption. In order to bring NFTs to the hundreds of millions of consumers, NFTs must be cheaper to mint. To tackle this volume-centric strategy, Origin will begin integrations with alternative blockchains and also explore Ethereum layer 2 solutions in Q3. Our goal is to enable creators to offer NFTs at $10 to $20 that can be purchased by their mainstream audiences in seconds with credit and debit cards. This will be especially important for NFT use cases related to merchandise, ticketing, and collectibles.")}}</p>

Users do not need to stake/unstake or provide liquidity to earn yields across underlying DeFi protocols. While past performance does not guarantee future results, to date OUSD has generated, through the underlying DeFi protocols, annualized yields between 20%% and 150%% at any given time.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD is a superior DeFi product for the masses. By removing all the complexities normally associated with earning fees through lending or supplying liquidity to automated market makers (AMMs), OUSD is highly accessible to users who are new to cryptocurrency technologies. Today, users need only to purchase OUSD on centralized exchanges or decentralized swap sites like Uniswap/Sushiswap to begin getting DeFi yield exposure immediately. Alternatively, users can mint OUSD with their existing stablecoins (DAI, USDT, USDC currently) on the <a href='https://www.ousd.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>OUSD DApp</a>.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Current APYs and circulating supply are published transparently on the <a href='https://analytics.ousd.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>OUSD dashboard</a>. ")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("With OUSD, there’s no need to unwind complicated positions when you want to spend your OUSD. You can transfer it freely without having to pay gas to unlock spendable capital. In addition, OUSD gives you the ability to utilize a basket of leading DeFi opportunities with none of the hassles. The OUSD smart contracts deploy your underlying capital to a diversified set of yield-earning strategies, automatically rebalancing over time to achieve strong yields while diversifying risk. Earnings automatically accrue in your wallet and compound continuously while you hold OUSD. Again, no staking or lockups are required, making your OUSD as easy to transfer as any other ERC-20 token. OUSD also serves as an ideal unit of account. DeFi participants no longer need complicated spreadsheets to calculate their earnings as they can easily see their constantly updated OUSD balances in real-time.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("Lending:")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("DeFi lending platforms let users lend and borrow crypto assets without any middlemen. Both lenders and borrowers get more value from their crypto. Lenders earn interest, while borrowers deposit crypto as collateral to gain access to credit without traditional banking headaches. DeFi lending platforms currently provide far superior returns for lenders than are generally available in the traditional markets.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD integrates with DeFi lending platforms that provide over-collateralized loans. Over-collateralization, combined with smart rules around liquidations, provide a reasonable level of security for lenders. Aave also additionally secures their lending pools with AAVE tokens respectively, further lowering risk.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD integrates with two leading lending providers, Compound and Aave, that have a proven track record audited smart contracts, and have successfully lent hundreds of millions of dollars without issue.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold">{{gettext("Market making:")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Automated market makers (AMMs) have quickly risen as the preferred form of decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network. This is in part due to the difficulty of supporting order book DEXes on Ethereum 1.0 that can rival the instant and low-slippage experiences on centralized exchanges. Further, AMMs like Uniswap are relatively user-friendly and gas-efficient to use.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("AMMs can only enable new markets when liquidity providers supply liquidity (e.g. multiple tokens for given trading pairs or pools). In return for providing liquidity, liquidity providers are rewarded with trading fees when other users swap tokens. For example, when traders swap USDT for USDC on Uniswap, they are currently charged 0.3%% on top of gas fees. These fees are distributed pro-rata to liquidity providers on the USDT-USDC pair based on the percentage of total liquidity that they have provided.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The OUSD protocol routes USDT, USDC, and DAI to highly-performing liquidity pools as determined by trading volume and rewards tokens (e.g. Balancer rewards BAL tokens to liquidity providers). Yields are then passed on to OUSD holders. The OUSD smart contract is currently integrated with Curve, and may be integrated with Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Balancer in the future.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("In addition to collecting interest from lending and fees from market making, we intend to automatically claim and convert the bonus incentives that are being distributed by many of the DeFi protocols. For example, Compound gives away COMP tokens, Balancer gives away BAL tokens, and Curve gives away CRV tokens. These bonus rewards will be regularly converted into stablecoins, deployed in the market, and distributed to OUSD holders in the form of additional yield.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD is able to generate higher yields than competing protocols due to a combination of important design decisions that amplify the rewards that are returned to OUSD holders:")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("OUSD is meant to be a tool that gives users easy and passive access to DeFi exposure. Origin’s role in the development of OUSD is ministerial rather than managerial. This means instead of actively managing OUSD as a business or actively managing the funds in the OUSD vault, Origin maintains the OUSD smart contracts as developers in order to keep the protocol functional and avoid catastrophic losses or failures for users. Origin does not intend to make strategic decisions to allocate funds from the OUSD vault. Funds in the OUSD vault are automatically deployed to the largest and most common DeFi protocols including Compound, Aave, and Curve, as outlined above. OUSD is a decentralized protocol on the Ethereum  blockchain without active management. Funds are allocated by OUSD smart contracts, not Origin employees, and Origin developers chose the aforementioned DeFi protocols for their safety and ubiquity in DeFi rather than to seek maximum yields or profits. The OUSD protocol is 100%% open-source and we are fast tracking OUSD to be governed in a totally decentralized fashion.")}}</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold text-uppercase">{{gettext("Benefits of OUSD")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Mainstream cryptocurrency users now have the equivalent of a high-yield savings account automatically built into their Ethereum wallets whenever they are holding OUSD. This increases DeFi’s addressable user base from tens to hundreds of thousands of sophisticated users to tens of millions of users instantly. By comparison, Uniswap, the most widely used DeFi product to date has only interacted with approximately 250k Ethereum wallets since its inception.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Because OUSD makes it easy for consumers to switch between spending and savings mode, it can also become the ideal medium of exchange. Today, many merchants other than those dealing in black or grey markets do not have many incentives to accept cryptocurrencies. Because most consumers currently use credit cards and mobile payments, merchants are forced to accept payments predominantly with these methods. In the process, they are often charged a 2.90%% credit card processing fee, with other payment intermediaries (e.g. merchant bankers and interchange networks) also increasing the cost of doing business. ")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("For merchants that have traditionally been skeptical of receiving cryptocurrency payments, being able to accept a yield-bearing stablecoin that beats traditional savings accounts and instantly earns yields at a minimum of 20%% APY is a powerful motivator. Instead of losing money on each sale, they are instantly adding capital to their merchant accounts that compounds instantly, giving them more operating capital over time. For merchants that oftentimes face cash flow management and inventory issues, being able to accept a yield-bearing form of payment is extremely compelling.")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("OUSD creates the incentives for merchants to not only accept, but promote the usage of cryptocurrencies in their businesses. As more users hold and make purchases with OUSD, more merchants will similarly accept OUSD. These powerful network effects have the potential to gradually replace the payment rails for both online and offline commerce.")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("In the short-term, OUSD’s target audience encompasses the millions of cryptocurrency users in the world that are not yet invested in DeFi. An even larger opportunity lies in targeting the hundreds of millions of users that are currently using traditional peer-to-peer and merchant payment systems.")}}</p>  
    <p>{{gettext("Today, PayPal boasts over 305M consumers and 22M merchants and processes over $200B of payments in a single quarter.

In China, cryptocurrency’s largest market by trading volume, Wechat and Alipay have near monopolistic holds on consumers and merchants. These simple, centralized payment apps are used by customers paying merchants and by friends and family transferring money to each other. Furthermore, in many markets, the US and Europe especially, bank cards are still the go-to way to spend money for online and offline transactions. Credit card companies, payment processors, and banks dominate this market and there are a variety of companies such as PayPal that assist merchants and consumers in using their cards online.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("We believe a new peer-to-peer payment app with an associated debit card built on top of the OUSD protocol can disrupt incumbents. Today, Venmo users shuffle money between their Venmo accounts and their checking accounts and credit cards. In the case of the former, money sitting in Venmo or checking accounts doesn’t earn any interest. Venmo balances that are funded by credit cards are even worse as there are fees charged by multiple intermediaries. In the later case, interest earned by users is usually negligible, especially when taking into account inflation. Cash back or rewards programs can offer users incentives but high interest rates for missing payments are a strong disincentive to users.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Tomorrow’s peer-to-peer mobile payment application powered by OUSD will introduce the killer feature of double-digit yields. Our version of Venmo will combine the ease of peer-to-peer payments with a high-yield savings account that beats traditional savings accounts by a factor of 10 to 100x.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The OUSD payment app will be built with a centralized mobile app and APIs to minimize user friction for mainstream users. Users will be able to deposit USD and/or other fiat currencies to the app and enjoy the seamless user experiences of centralized applications. However, on the backend, these fiat deposits will be used to mint OUSD. New users will hold their balances in OUSD in Origin custodial wallets without needing to understand cryptocurrencies. They will simply be able to earn industry-leading yields when they are not spending. Again, your OUSD is always earning & ready to be spent or transferred at the same time.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The viral effects of the future OUSD payment app cannot be overstated. Payment apps are by nature already viral, with users onboarding their friends and family in order to transact with them, establishing powerful network effects. Merchants quickly adopt the payment services that attract the most users. By adding in the ability to earn yield the very instant that any new referred user accepts funds from a referring user, we believe the viral coefficient for existing users referring new users will be multiples higher than ever seen before in a traditional payments application.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The OUSD debit card will be tied to the future OUSD payment app and will allow users to spend down their on-app OUSD balance. Whenever users want to use their OUSD, their OUSD will be converted to USD via Visa’s interchange network and be instantly accepted by 40 million merchants all over the world. Merchants will receive USD and need not know that OUSD was used as the underlying original currency to power the transaction. Again, when users’ OUSD is not being spent, it will automatically accumulate staggering yields that should be superior to any cash bank or credit card rewards program in existence.")}}</p>

Users will be able to eject from the managed wallet at any point in time to simply hold their OUSD in their own self-managed wallets within the same app. We imagine that more and more users will gradually migrate from managed wallets to self-hosted wallets over time as they become educated about the benefits of underlying protocol.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("The incentives to accept OUSD as a merchant over traditional credit cards or mobile payments is extremely compelling. Merchants can earn double-digit yields upon the sales of goods and services versus getting taxed with multiple payment fees.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("The very first e-commerce platform to accept OUSD is Origin’s own Dshop platform. However, Dshop is a relatively new platform, and the majority of online e-commerce stores are run by incumbents like Shopify and Woo Commerce.")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("Thankfully, both Shopify and Woo Commerce have mature developer platforms and APIs. We intend to build applications on these existing platforms that allow merchants to accept OUSD directly from customers that want to pay with OUSD. These developer plugins are relatively simple to build, and there are many existing examples of working payment alternatives.")}}</p>

    <p>{{gettext("Ethereum is by far the most dominant layer 1 chain when it comes to DeFi activity and total value locked (TVL) today. However, as other layer 1 chains gain DeFi adoption, it is our intention to make OUSD accessible on other chains like Binance Smart Chain, Solana, Cosmos, and Polkadot which offer faster transactions and lower gas costs. ")}}</p>
    <p>{{gettext("All of the yield for OUSD will continue to be generated on the Ethereum platform since that’s where the vast majority of capital and earning opportunities exist today. However, chain-specific versions of OUSD will be mintable by anyone who locks up OUSD in the cross-chain bridge. For example, you could lock 100 OUSD in the Solana bridge in order to generate 100 sOUSD which would be freely transferable within the Solana ecosystem. The original OUSD would stay locked in a smart contract where it would continue earning yield. Inside Solana, the circulating sOUSD tokens would rebase in lockstep with the OUSD that was locked in the smart contract. Anyone who wishes to exit would be able to redeem their sOUSD for the originally locked capital plus any yield that was generated while they were holding it.")}}</p>
